complete and I am not able to keep track of contributions.

So I wand to thank all the people who helped in one or another way:

 - By sending reports about problems.

 - By running debug sessions.

 - By sending patches for bug fixes or new teatures.

 - By providing all the libraries that davfs2 uses directly or indirectly.

 - By providing all the tools used to create this program.

 - By providing the free GNU/Linux operating system.
