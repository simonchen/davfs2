/* This is lazy programming. All the dirty work is left to the real umount
   program, while we just sit and wait for mount.davfs to terminate.
   umount.davfs is a umount helper. It is usually called by umount and makes
   sure, that umount will not return until mount.davfs has synchronized all
   files.
   It first reads the pid-file and identifies the mount.davfs process. Then
   it calls mount again, with option -i (to not be called again), to do the
   real unmounting. In a loop it will watch the process list. When the
   mount.davfs process terminates, it will return.
   If it can't identify the mount.davfs process, it will call umount -i anyway,
   but warn the user. */
